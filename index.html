As a Life Coach I am committed to helping you unlock your potential, find clarity, and navigate life’s challenges with confidence. As an experienced life coach working towards accreditation with the International Coaching Federation (ICF PCC), I combine professional expertise with deep compassion to inspire and empower individuals to thrive.

With a degree in linguistic and cultural mediation, I coach in both English and Italian and also speak French and Spanish.

I have extensive experience in learning and development, having spent years coaching my cohort of students who were working towards their management qualifications, helping them gain promotions and strengthen their confidence and self-belief. Having held leadership roles myself, I’ve successfully helped others step into managerial positions, equipping them with the tools and mindset needed to lead their team with confidence and purpose.

Currently, I also work as a consultant, delivering diversity and inclusion training and LGBTQ+ advocacy workshops to organizations, schools, and companies. Through this work, I aim to foster greater understanding, empathy, and inclusion in workplaces and society at large. I also volunteer with charities, facilitating anti-bullying workshops in schools and working with immigrants and refugees in amateur physical theatre settings to connect, learn their stories, and celebrate their resilience through creative expression.

I am a spiritual person who believes deeply in the power of human energy. I see the potential in every person and work to help individuals tap into their inner strength, build self-awareness, and align their energy with their aspirations. I bring personal insights and first hand experience into parenthood and adoption, offering compassionate guidance to families navigating these transformative journeys.

My coaching is grounded in core values of inclusion, equity, and authenticity. As a passionate advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and an activist against racial inequalities, I provide a safe, affirming space for all clients to explore their paths and pursue their goals.

Described as inspiring, wise, and approachable by those I’ve worked with, I strive to empower you to overcome challenges, build self-awareness, and create a fulfilling life aligned with your values and aspirations.

Whether you’re seeking support with relationships, identity, career advancement, or personal growth, I am here to guide you every step of the way.

Let’s create the life you deserve—together.

What if our mind was a garden?

WEEDS - Comparison to others, unhealthy competition
How many seeds are we planting?

Are we plucking weeds?
